### 4. ✅ Historical Data Implementation

## Issues Remaining

### 1. Server Build Error
- Next.js is having webpack issues after clearing .next directory
- This is preventing us from testing the fixes live

### 2. Symbol Extraction Refinement Needed
- Currently picks up words like "HOW", "DOING" as symbols
- Need better filtering of common English words

## Test Results Analysis

From the test runs before the server issues:
- Stock lookups: Working well (67% pass rate)
- Market explanations: Excellent (93% pass rate)
- Financial advice: Good (85% pass rate)
- Historical data: Needs the server fixes to test properly
- Comparisons: Will improve with the company name mapping

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Fix the server build issue (may need to restart fresh)
2. Add more extensive word filtering to prevent false symbol matches
3. Test all the improvements with the full test suite
4. Consider adding caching for frequently requested symbols
