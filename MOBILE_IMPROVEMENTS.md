## Key Responsive Patterns Used

1. **Breakpoint Strategy**:
   - Mobile-first approach with `sm:` (640px+) and `md:` (768px+) breakpoints
   - Occasionally used `lg:` (1024px+) for larger layouts

2. **Common Responsive Utilities**:
   - Text sizes: `text-sm sm:text-base`, `text-lg sm:text-xl`
   - Padding: `p-3 sm:p-4`, `px-3 sm:px-4`
   - Icons: `w-4 h-4 sm:w-5 sm:h-5`
   - Gaps: `gap-2 sm:gap-3`

3. **Layout Adjustments**:
   - Grids changing from single column to multi-column
   - Flex containers using `flex-wrap` for better mobile layout
   - Adjusted heights for better mobile viewport usage

4. **Typography Hierarchy**:
   - Maintained visual hierarchy while scaling down for mobile
   - Ensured readability with appropriate text sizes

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test on actual devices at these viewport widths:
   - 320px (small phones)
   - 375px (iPhone SE/standard)
   - 414px (larger phones)
   - 768px (tablets)

2. Check for:
   - Text readability
   - Touch target sizes (minimum 44x44px)
   - Scroll behavior
   - Chart/graph visibility
   - Interactive elements accessibility

3. Performance considerations:
   - Ensure smooth animations on lower-end devices
   - Check for layout shifts during loading
   - Verify chart rendering performance

## Future Improvements

1. Consider adding:
   - Landscape orientation specific styles
   - Touch gestures for charts
   - Mobile-specific navigation patterns
   - Reduced motion options for accessibility

2. Potential optimizations:
   - Lazy loading for heavy components
   - Mobile-specific image sizes
   - Simplified animations for mobile
