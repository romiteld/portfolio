## Active Decisions

- Creating a 3D visualization of the chess board using React Three Fiber that works alongside the existing 2D view
- Initially implementing the 3D view as a spectator mode, with gameplay still handled by the 2D board
- Using simple geometric shapes as placeholders before implementing detailed 3D models
- Focusing on proper lighting, materials, and camera positioning for an optimal 3D view
- Using the same move generation and validation logic for both 2D and 3D views
- Maintaining the codebase clean by properly excluding large model files from git tracking

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Integration Approach**: Using Supabase to store the ONNX model and Next.js API routes for move generation.

2. **User Interface**: Using custom chess board component styled with Tailwind CSS to match portfolio design.

3. **Architecture**: Client-side chess board with serverless backend for move generation, accessing model stored in Supabase.

4. **Styling**: Maintaining consistency with the portfolio's Tailwind CSS patterns and design language.

5. **Code Organization**: Following the established patterns in the portfolio structure for demos.

6. **Performance**: Optimizing the chess board rendering and move generation for low latency.

7. **User Experience**: Creating a seamless experience between the chess demo and the rest of the portfolio.

## Current Challenges
