## Active Decisions

- Focusing on a clean, intuitive chess UI consistent with the portfolio design
- Prioritizing critical fixes for game end detection and UI feedback
- Implementing proper move visualization with highlighted squares
- Adding a move history panel with standard algebraic notation
- Improving game controls for better player experience
- Addressing the recursive function bug that causes stack overflow errors
- Using Supabase for model storage and retrieval due to:
  - Integration with the existing portfolio infrastructure
  - Simplified deployment without needing Python backend
  - Cost-effective solution compared to dedicated ML infrastructure
- Using ONNX format for model deployment due to its:
  - Cross-platform compatibility
  - Optimization capabilities
  - Integration with both backend and frontend
- Moving away from Docker/GPU backend to a more lightweight approach with:
  - Model stored in Supabase
  - Serverless functions for move generation
  - Client-side rendering for chess board

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Integration Approach**: Using Supabase to store the ONNX model and Next.js API routes for move generation.

2. **User Interface**: Using custom chess board component styled with Tailwind CSS to match portfolio design.

3. **Architecture**: Client-side chess board with serverless backend for move generation, accessing model stored in Supabase.

4. **Styling**: Maintaining consistency with the portfolio's Tailwind CSS patterns and design language.

5. **Code Organization**: Following the established patterns in the portfolio structure for demos.

6. **Performance**: Optimizing the chess board rendering and move generation for low latency.

7. **User Experience**: Creating a seamless experience between the chess demo and the rest of the portfolio.

## Current Challenges

1. **Chess AI Bug Fixes**:
   - Stack overflow error during move generation for certain positions
   - Missing game end detection and UI feedback
   - Recursive function calls causing performance issues

2. **Chess UI Enhancement**:
   - Limited visual feedback for players (legal moves, check, etc.)
   - Missing game control elements (new game, undo, etc.)
   - No move history display
   - Basic layout with insufficient spacing and responsiveness
   - Limited game state management

3. **Chess AI Performance**:
   - High latency for move generation in certain positions
   - Limited visual feedback during AI "thinking" time
   - Need for better error handling and recovery

4. **Overall Improvements**:
   - Need for consistent styling with the rest of the portfolio
   - Better responsiveness across different devices
   - More professional look and feel
   - Enhanced player experience with proper game flow
