## Current Status Summary
The portfolio is functional and demonstrates core skills. The chess AI implementation is now using Lc0 fine-tuning with a 256x10 distilled network. We've set up the infrastructure for downloading the network model and training data, created configuration for fine-tuning with frozen layers, and implemented training and benchmarking scripts. 

The financial assistant has been significantly enhanced with a secure Supabase vector database, with security fixes implemented to properly isolate the vector extension and secure the match_documents function. We've fixed JSX structure issues that were causing rendering errors, implemented detailed news article content with a working modal interface, and improved API error handling and response validation for more robust operation. We've also fixed TypeScript errors in the StockChart component and improved its accessibility.

The next steps are to execute the fine-tuning process for the chess AI, evaluate the model, and integrate it with the frontend chess demo. For the financial assistant, we need to populate the embedding values in the documents table, implement automated scheduled updates, and develop the enhanced visualization features.

Note: Market status check in Firecrawl API route uses simulation.
