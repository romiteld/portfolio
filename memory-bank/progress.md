## Current Status Summary
The portfolio is functional and demonstrates core skills. The chess AI implementation has been enhanced with a 3D visualization option using React Three Fiber and Three.js, allowing users to toggle between traditional 2D and 3D views. The 3D view currently functions as a spectator mode with basic geometric pieces, with plans to add more detailed models and animations.

The Git repository has been optimized by removing large model files from tracking history, with models now stored exclusively in Supabase. This significantly reduces repository size and improves clone/pull performance.

The chess AI is using a Lc0 fine-tuned model with a 256x10 distilled network. The infrastructure for downloading, training, and benchmarking is in place, and we've fixed various issues with the fine-tuning process.

The financial assistant has a secure Supabase vector database with proper security measures, fixed UI issues, and improved error handling. 

The next steps include completing the 3D chess visualization with detailed models and animations, improving UI/UX elements of the chess demo, executing further fine-tuning of the chess AI model, and enhancing the financial assistant visualization capabilities.
